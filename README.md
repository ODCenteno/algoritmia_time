# Algoritmia Time

Personal project to practice different algorithms
.
The aim of this project is to learn and understand the most common algorithms to solve problems in computer science.

Learn, practice, repeat.

### ¿What you can find?

The code solving algorithms and a concise explanation. I'll use different sources to learn from.

### ¿Where is the list of algorithms coming from?

There are a lot of websites and blogs that make there own list of
basics algorithms every developer should know. Although, you can start with the
[Top Algorithms/Data Structures/Concepts every computer science student should know](https://medium.com/techie-delight/top-algorithms-data-structures-concepts-every-computer-science-student-should-know-e0549c67b4ac).

### List of reviewed Algorithms

* Sorting Algorithms
    * Bubble sort
